# Steam Trade Offer Enhancer

Modified version of [Steam Trade Offer Enhancer](https://github.com/scholtzm/steam-trade-offer-enhancer) (original by [HusKy](https://github.com/scholtzm)).

Added features include easy options for adding keys, metal, or listing price from backpack.tf. You are also able to select an index from where to pick items from when adding items.

To add the listing price you must open a trade offer from a link on classifieds pages using the trade offer button (not the "Send xxxxx an offer" button on popovers). You must also have the buyer's inventory open for the button to appear.
